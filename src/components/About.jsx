        <p className="lead text-center">
          My journey into programming began with a frozen video game. What started as a moment of frustration quickly turned into curiosity about what was happening behind the scenes. That curiosity sparked a passion for building my own worlds, not just playing in them. Today, I see programming as a powerful tool for creative problem-solving and for bringing ideas to life. I am driven by a desire to create software that is not only technically solid but also meaningful—software that can teach, inspire, or simply make people happy.

        <p className="lead text-center">
          I am a Grade 12 student at Unionville High School, with a passion for game design, computer science, digital art, and engineering. I enjoy working on hands-on projects, learning new tools, and experimenting with creative ideas where I can mix programming with digital media.

          I'm a creative problem-solver and a fast learner, especially with new AI tools. I have strong coding fundamentals and a good eye for digital art and visual design. I'm an independent and self-driven person with good time management skills, which has helped me build a strong project history on GitHub.
